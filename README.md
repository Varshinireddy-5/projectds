# Fake News Detection

This project is designed to classify news articles as either **fake** or **real** using machine learning techniques. It leverages a dataset of labeled news articles to train a model that can predict the authenticity of a given news article.

## Features
- Preprocessed dataset for training and testing
- Machine learning-based classification
- Script for testing new articles
- Accuracy evaluation and performance metrics

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fakenews-detection.git
   cd fakenews-detection
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the model training script:
   ```bash
   python pro.py
   ```

## Dataset
- `True.csv`: Contains real news articles.
- `Fake.csv`: Contains fake news articles.
- `manual_testing.csv`: Sample dataset for testing the trained model.

## Usage
- Train the model using `pro.py`.
- Test new articles using the trained model.
- Evaluate the accuracy and fine-tune the model if needed.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests.
